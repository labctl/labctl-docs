# Roadmap

These are more ideas of where labctl could go than a roadmap. Input welcome ðŸ˜‰

- [x] Update the topology on file changes
- [ ] Add more state & telemetry options to the frontend.
- [ ] Add manual links & nodes not part of the topo file. (Link multiple topologies, show external testers etc)
- [ ] Remove some dependencies to get it running on more platforms (Linux today)
